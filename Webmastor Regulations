# Github Owners

A Github Owner is a person who is listed as an owner of the Agora 
organization on Github. There should be 3 Github Owners at any time.

The Ideal Criteria for a Github Owner are as follows:

* First registered for Agora at least 5 years Agora

* Has been registered in Agora in each of the last 3 years (not 
necessarily continuously)

* Is familiar with git and github

* Is a current player

The Webmastor should always be a Github Owner.

When there are less than 3 Github Owners, the Webmastor should make the 
closest consenting match to the Ideal Criteria a Github Owner.

When there is a consenting closer match to the Ideal Criteria than a 
current Github Owner, the Webmastor may demote said current Github owner
and promote the closer match, with 3 support.

# Maintaining Repositories

The Maintainer of a repository is the only person who should push 
directly to the repository, unless e has given permission to another 
person.

If a another person wishes to update a repository, e should do so by
creating a fork and a pull request, and letting the maintainer merge the
request.

The Webmastor is the maintainer of the agoranomic.org repository. E 
may update the repository only if:

* e does so without objection

* e is only updating dates, numbers, or links

* e is updating the header

The Webmastor is the maintainer of the Header repository. E may update 
it without objection.

For each repository that represents an office, the current officeholder 
is the maintainer.

# Live Reports

A Live Report is a webpage that displays a non-official version of an 
Agora report, with the intent of being updated frequently.

A Live Report SHOULD note that it is unofficial and clearly mark the 
time (to the minute) and date that it was last updated. It should also 
link to a copy of the most recent official report.
