# Github Owners

A Github Owner is a person who is listed as an owner of the Agora organization on Github. There should be 3 Github Owners at any time.

The Ideal Criteria, in no particular order, for a Github Owner are as follows:

* First registered for Agora at least 5 years ago

* Has been registered in Agora in each of the last 3 years (not necessarily continuously)

* Is familiar with git and github

* Is a current player

The Webmastor should always be a Github Owner.

When there are less than 3 Github Owners, the Webmastor should make the closest consenting match to the Ideal Criteria a Github Owner.

When a person becomes less Ideal (for example, by deregistering) the Webmastor may replace them with someone who is more Ideal with consent of the new person.

# Maintaining Repositories

The Maintainer of a Repository is:

* The Webmastor, if the repository is agoranomic.org or Headers

* The Officer, if the repository is named after an office

For all other repositories owned by AgoraNomic, the maintainer is either the person who created it or the person who most recently adopted it. Any person can adopt such a repository by announcement if the current maintainer has not updated it in 2 months.

Persons SHOULD NOT directly push to repositories they are not the maintainer of without explicit permission. Instead, they SHOULD submit a pull request.

If a repository includes Headers as a submodule, the Webmastor MAY push directly to that repository for the sole purpose of updating to the latest Headers.

The Webmastor SHOULD NOT update Headers without announcing intent to do so at least 48 hours earlier.

The Webmastor should only update the main page:

* if e is only updating numbers, dates, or other small factual things

* or if e has announced intent to do so without objection and has not received objections since doing so at least 4 days ago.

# Live Reports

A Live Report is a webpage that displays a non-official version of an Agora report, with the intent of being updated frequently.

A Live Report SHOULD note that it is unofficial and clearly mark the time (to the minute) and date that it was last updated. It should also link to a copy of the most recent official report.
