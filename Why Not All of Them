Purpose: a rule that allows multiple subgames to exist while only one is played at a time.

I intend to, after some time for review, submit the following proposal, "Roulette Gaming", with AI=1:

Enact a power-0.6 rule titled "Sub Game Selection" with the following text {

If a rule with power less than the power of this rule declares itself a "Sub Game Rule" in its text, all other parts of its text are null and void unless this rule states otherwise.

Roulette Arrow is a singleton switch, tracked by the Registrar, with possible values of all Sub Game Rules and null.

When a player wins by a mechanism specified in a Sub Game Rule, the Roulette Arrow is flipped to null.

The Registrar CAN flip the Roulette Arrow to null without objection.

If the Roulette Arrow is flipped to null the Registrar CAN, by announcement, flip it to any Sub Game Rule. E SHOULD flip it to one randomly.

The text of a Sub Game Rule is valid and in effect as long as the Roulette Arrow switch is flipped to it.

}
