Amend R2438, "Ribbons", by replacing:

      The Tailor is an office, and the recordkeepor of Ribbons.
      
      Ribbon Ownership is a secured person switch, tracked by the
      Tailor in eir monthly report, whose values are the subsets of
      the set of types of Ribbon, defaulting to the empty set. If the
      rules are amended to change the types of Ribbon, if a player's
      Ribbon Ownership is subsequently illegal, then it is updated by
      removing all nonexistent types rather than resetting the entire
      value to default.
      
      To "award a person a <Ribbon type>" is to add that type of Ribbon
      to that person's Ribbon Ownership. A person "owns a <Ribbon type>"
      if that type of Ribbon is an element of eir Ribbon Ownership.
      
      A person qualifies for a type of Ribbon if e has earned that type
      of Ribbon within the preceding 7 days (including earlier in the
      same message).
      
      While a person owns all types of Ribbon, that person can Raise a
      Banner by announcement. This causes that person to win the game.
      That person's Ribbon Ownership becomes the empty set.
      
      The types of Ribbon, and the methods of obtaining them, are as
      follows:
      
with

      The Tailor is an office, and the Recordkeepor of Ribbons.

      A person has a Ribbon if e has been awarded that type of Ribbon 
      and eir Ribbon ownership has not been reset since e last was
      awarded it. If a person has been awarded a Ribbon by any previous
      Ribbon rules since eir ownership was last reset, then e owns that
      Ribbon.

      If a player has every type of Ribbon defined in this rule, then e 
      CAN win by "banner raising" by announcement. When e does so 
      successfully, eir Ribbon ownership is reset.

      Other rules notwithstanding, any player CAN award a person a 
      Ribbon by announcement if, and only if, that person has earned
      it in the last 7 days, does not already have it, and has not
      had eir Ribbon ownership reset since last earning it.

      The types of Ribbons, and the method for earning each one, are as
      follows:
