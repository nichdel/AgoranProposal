Amend R2478, "Vigilante Justice" by adding after the list items:

    Initiating a Finger Pointing found to be Shenanigans is the class 
    0+N crime of Unjustified Gesticulation, where N is the number of 
    times e has previously committed the crime in the current Agoran 
    Week.

and by adding, to the very end of the rule:

    The player who initiated the most Finger Pointings that resulted 
    in an Indictment or Cold Hand of Justice in the previous Agoran 
    Week CAN once grant emself a Justice Card by announcement.

[This is more or less functionally the same as a previous version. The main notable difference is that I replaced "previous 7 days" with Agoran Weeks. I just think this is easier to figure out without requiring someone to track it. ]
