AI: 1

Create a power=0.5 rule titled “Mx. Popular” with the following text {

When this rule is enacted, a Popularity* Contest begins. Any player in the current Popularity* Contest is a Contestant, and becoming a Contestant is the same as entering the Popularity* Contest. When a new Popularity* Contest begins, every currently registered player becomes a Contestant. When a player who has not been a Contestant in the current Popularity* Contest joins the game, e becomes a Contestant.

Target is a Contestant switch with possible values of Contestants and a null value, defaulting to a null value. Once a day, each Contestant CAN, by announcement, flip eir Target switch to any valid value. 

Designated Target is a singleton switch with possible values of Contestants and a null value, defaulting to a null value. At least a week after the current Popularity* Contest began, and at least a week after the last time the Designated Target switch was flipped, if there are more than 3 Contestants, any player CAN, by announcement, attempt to flip the Designated Target switch. The Designated Target switch MAY only be flipped to the Contestant, if any, that the most Target switches are set to. If there is a tie, the Designated Target switch CAN only be flipped to the Contestant included in the tie that least recently flipper eir Target switch. If there is still a tie, or all Contestant switches are set to null, the Designated Target switch MAY be flipped to any Contestant. An attempt to flip the Designated Target is only successful if the player doing so also correctly identifies the value of each Target switch in the same message. When the Designated Contestant switch is flipped, the Contestant it is set to exits the Contest.

The Exclusivity Fee is a singleton switch with possible values of all integers, defaulting to 0. Any player not in the Popularity* Contest CAN join the Popularity* Contest by paying at least the Exclusivity Fee in coins. When a player pays more than the Exclusivity Fee to join the Popularity* Contest, the Exclusivity Fee is set to the amount e paid.

Mx. Popular is a player switch with possible values of Contestants (minus the owner of the switch) and a null value, defaulting to a null value. Each player CAN flip eir Mx. Popular switch, by announcement, to any valid value (except null) once a day. If a player exits the Popularity* Contest, all Mx. Popular switches set to that player are set to null. If a Contestant is uniquely the value of more Mx. Popular switches than any other Contestant, and there are 3 or less Contestants, e CAN declare emself Mx. Popular by announcement. Such a declaration is only successful if e correctly identifies the value of every Mx. Popular switch in the same message. When a Contestant does so successfully: e wins, every Mx. Popular switch is flipped to null, every Target switch is flipped to null, the Exclusivity Fee is flipped to 0, a new Popularity* Contest begins, and every currently registered player joins the new Popularity* Contest.
