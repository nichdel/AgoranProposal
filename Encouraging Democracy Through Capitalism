I submit the following proposal:

Title: Encouraging Democracy Through Capitalism
AI: 1

Amend rule 2496 by replacing the current text {

      * Publishing an office's weekly or monthly report, provided that
        publication was the first report published for that office in
        the relevant time period (week or month respectively) to fulfill
        an official weekly or monthly duty: 5 coins.
        
} with the text {

      * Publishing an office's weekly or monthly report, provided that
        publication was the first report published for that office in
        the relevant time period (week or month respectively) to fulfill
        an official weekly or monthly duty: 3 coins for an interim office
        or 5 coins for any other office.
        
}

Reasoning: Elections are Fun and Cool and help spread the workload and reduce consolidation.
