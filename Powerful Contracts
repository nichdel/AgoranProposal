Powerful Contracts

Power Target is a player switch tracked by the Notary with the potential
values None (the default), and any Contract. A player CAN flip eir Power
Target (empower) by announcement once a week.

If there is a single contract that is the value of at least 5 Power
Target switches and is the target of the most Power Target switches, it
is Empowered.

Any player CAN create a Victory Card in the possession of the Empowered
contract by announcement. This CANNOT be done if it has already been
done this week.
