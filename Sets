Enact a new Power=1 rule titled "Cards & Sets" with the text:

      Cards are a type of asset with a corresponding Product. Products are
      also assets. The types of Cards and their corresponding Products are:

      * Victory Cards and Victory Points.

      * Justice Cards and Blot-B-Gones

      * Legislative Cards and Pendants

      * Voting Cards and Voting Proxies

      A player CAN, by announcement, pay a 'set' of X Cards of the same type
      to create in eir possession Y corresponding Products. The value of X
      determines the value of Y in the following ways:

      * 1 Card = 1 Product

      * 2 Cards = 3 Products

      * 3 Cards = 6 Products

      * 4 Cards = 10 Products

      A player CANNOT pay more than 4 Cards as one 'set'.

      Cards and Products are tracked by the Treasuror.

For each player that is not a zombie, create one of each type of card in eir
possession.

[The core of this proposal. Collect cards to make the other assets.

I've been considering whether to have the Treasuror track everything or make a
new role. I think there's pros and cons to both. I don't want to overtax the
Treasuror but I also don't want to split rule-defined assets across multiple
officers if it's not necessary.

Also I'm not happy with Victory Points or Voting Proxies. Name suggestions for
those are welcome.]

Amend rule 2499 "Welcome Packages" by replacing:

      When a player receives a Welcome Package, e earns 10 coins.

with:

      When a player receives a Welcome Package, e earns 10 coins and one of
      each type of Card defined in the rules.

[Simple Welcome package addition]

Amend rule 2483 "Economics" by removing the following line:

      A player CAN win the game by paying a fee of 1,000 Coins.

[Ultimately counter to an economy where we want constant trading and asset
movement.]

Enact a new Power=1 rule titled "VP Wins" with the following text:

      If a player has 20 more Victory Points than any other player, e can win
      by announcement. When a player wins this way, destroy all Cards and
      their corresponding Products. Then, for each player create 1 card of
      each type in eir possession.

[Exactly what it says on the tin.]

Amend rule 2555 "Blots" by replacing the following paragraph:

      If a person (the penitent) has neither gained blots nor had more
      than 2 blots expunged from emself in the current Agoran week, then
      any player (the confessor) who has not, by this mechanism,
      expunged any blots in the current Agoran week CAN expunge 1 blot
      from the penitent, by announcement.

with:

      Any player CAN, by announcement, expunge a blot from a specified person
      (or emself if no one is specified) by paying a fee of one Blot-B-Gone.

[Pretty straightforward, now you need to use Blot-B-Gones to get rid of Blots
(except for the fugitive decay, I left that in).]

Amend rule 2350 "Proposals" by replacing:

      Creating a proposal adds it to the Proposal Pool.

with:

      A player CAN add a proposal to the Proposal Pool by paying one Pendant.

[Make Pendants do the pending thing.]

Amend rule 2422 "Voting Strength" by adding:

      A player CAN pay 1 Voting Proxy to increase eir voting strength on a
      specified Agoran decision by 1. E may do so up to 3 times for a single
      decision.

[This makes proxies pretty flexible actually, maybe too much? But I think it's
fun and can at most double your base power.]

Amend rule 2476 Ownership by removing:

      Assets owned by the Lost and Found Department can be transferred or
      destroyed by any player without objection.

Create a new Power=1 rule titled "VP Auctions" with the following text:

      Once a week the Treasuror CAN and SHOULD initiate an auction. The first
      lot for this auction is a Victory Card created in Agora's possession
      when the auction is initiated. The second lot is all of any single type
      of asset owned by the Lost and Found Department. The Treasuror is the
      Auctioneer for this auction and the minimum bid is 1 coin.

[Would love some feedback here. I personally love this idea conceptually but I
want it to be manageable for the Treasuror.]

Create a new Power=1 rule titled "Card Administration" with the following
text:

      Justice Cards are associated with the Ministry of Justice. Legislative
      Cards are associated with the Ministry of Legislation. Voting Cards are
      associated with the ministry of Participation.

      Officers CAN, once per month and by announcement, create a Card in the
      possession of another player under the following conditions:

      * the Card is associated with a ministry that is an in the interest
         switch of at least one office the officer holds AND

      * the player receiving the Card does not hold an office with the Card's
         associated ministry in its interests.

[I feel like the wording of this could be simplified? Also, should Speaker and
Prime Minister be excluded from the restrictions on the receiving player? As
it stands they basically can't receive cards this way at all.]
